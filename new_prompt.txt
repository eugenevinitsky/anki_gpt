Please help me create Anki cards for some material that I am studying. I would like to use these cards to remember facts and information in this material. Each Anki card should be of the format: 

{FRONT} ; {BACK} 

where {FRONT} is the front of the card, and {BACK} is the back of the card, and they are separated by a semi-colon. The way it works is that Anki will show me the {FRONT} of the card, which contains some kind of question, and I will have to correctly recall the {BACK} of the card. Please give me the Anki cards one per line so it is easy for me to copy paste and import them into Anki. Make sure to be thorough and cover most of the information in the given material. The answer should be terse and only a few words, Anki cards should be short and atomic. Here are some examples of good Anki cards: 

What is the capital city of California? ; Sacramento 
How many U.S. states are there? ; 50 
What is the smallest U.S. state? ; Wyoming 
Etc. 

Now here is the material Iâ€™d like you to create Anki cards for:
